    <h1>DEMO DEMO DEMO</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2> 
    <p>Get ready, coders, data analyzers, and bear-lovers of the world...
      <br>
      <b>Python Pandas</b> is about to be your new best friend! 
    </p>  
    <p>
      Pandas is an open-source Python library geared towards complex data analysis. While your typical <code>.py</code> file can handle dealing with numbers and data to a small extent, Python either doesn't support or is very slow at configuring large-scale data. Here's where Pandas comes in: it utilizes <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> to manipulate data on a macro scale.
    </p>
    <h2>How To Use</h2> 
    <p>Pandas is a package that requires installation via <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">pip</a>, a Python package manager. Once you've run "pip install pandas", pandas'll be easily accessible in your Python file through "import pandas". 
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Data Strutures in Pandas</h2> 
    <h3>Series</h3>
    <p>
      Series in pandas are one-dimensional objects similar to lists or arrays. They hold indexed items that operations and functions can be applied to.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Series can be manipulated really easily -- you can pick and choose elements to change, get a list of things that meet certain boolean criteria, concatenate series together, and do mathematical operations, and the list goes on.</p> 
    <p>
      Contextualized data and things with categories are far easier to visualize with pandas than with generic Python, making it a more user-friendly package.
    </p>
    <h3>Constructing and Using Series</h3>
    <p>To create a series:
      <code>
	seriesName = pandas.Series(['a', 'b', 'c']) 
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>Printing seriesName would output: 
      <code>
	0    a
	1    b
	2    c
	dtype: object
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>Operations Using Series</h3>
    <p>
      Series contain indexed data values. The indices are changeable, for further readability. 
      <code> 
	seriesName.index = ["Letter 1", "Letter 2", "Letter 3"] 
      </code>
      <br>
      Printing seriesName now would return: 
      <code> 
	Letter 1    a
	Letter 2    b
	Letter 3    c
	dtype: object
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, mathematical operations can be performed (if possible) on all data values within a Series or a specific index.

    <h2>The code only gets messier from here on out...</h2> 
    <p> Coding is difficult!<br> 
      Wouldn't it be lovely if Eric worked on this too? :'(
