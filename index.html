    <h1>PYTHON PANDAS</h1>
    <center><img src="pandas.jpg"></img></center>



    <h2>Intro</h2> 
    <p>Get ready, coders, data analyzers, and bear-lovers of the world...
      <br>
      <b>Python Pandas</b> is about to be your new best friend! 
    </p>  
    <p>
      Pandas is an open-source Python library geared towards complex data analysis. While your typical <code>.py</code> file can handle dealing with numbers and data to a small extent, Python either doesn't support or is very slow at configuring large-scale data. Here's where Pandas comes in: it utilizes <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> to manipulate data on a macro scale.
    </p>



    <h2>How To Use</h2> 
    <p>Pandas is a package that requires installation via <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">pip</a>, a Python package manager. Once you've run "pip install pandas", pandas'll be easily accessible in your Python file through "import pandas". 
    </p>



    <h2>Types of Data Strutures in Pandas</h2> 



    <h2>Series</h2>
    <p>
      Series in pandas are one-dimensional objects similar to lists or arrays. They hold indexed items that operations and functions can be applied to.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Series can be manipulated really easily -- you can pick and choose elements to change, get a list of things that meet certain boolean criteria, concatenate series together, and do mathematical operations, and the list goes on.</p> 
    <p>
      Contextualized data and things with categories are far easier to visualize with pandas than with generic Python, making it a more user-friendly package.
    </p>


    <h3>Constructing and Using Series</h3>
    <p>To create a series:
      <code>
	seriesName = pandas.Series(['a', 'b', 'c']) 
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>Printing seriesName would output: 
      <code>
	0    a
	1    b
	2    c
	dtype: object
      </code>
    </p>


    <h3>Operations Using Series</h3>
    <p>
      Series contain indexed data values. The indices are changeable, for further readability. 
      <code> 
	seriesName.index = ["Letter 1", "Letter 2", "Letter 3"] 
      </code>
      <br>
      Printing seriesName now would return: 
      <code> 
	Letter 1    a
	Letter 2    b
	Letter 3    c
	dtype: object
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, mathematical operations can be performed (if possible) on all data values within a Series or a specific index. For example, printing <code>seriesName * 2</code> would return: 
      <code> 
	Letter 1    zz
	Letter 2    bb
	Letter 3    cc
	dtype: object
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>


    <h2>DataFrames</h2>
    <p>
      DataFrames is a data structure made up of rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or a table. It¡¯s pretty much a group of series that share an index.
    </p>
    <p>
      DataFrames are mostly advantageous in that data from outside sources can easily be read into one in one step. In addition, DataFrames are really good with math operations and slicing, so values are easy to access and change efficiently.
    </p>


    <h3>Constructing DataFrames</h3>
    <p>
      DataFrames are the most commonly used Pandas object. It takes a bunch of inputs, including arrays, Series, other DataFrames, and tuples. The constructor will take any 2-dimensional object where rows and columns can be clearly identified. Let's create a sample DataFrame using a dictionary:
    </p>
    <code>
      dict = {"name": ["John", "Bob", "Sara", "Balthazar"], 
              "class": [2011, 2016, 2017, 2020],
              "grade": [88, 90, 92, 94]
         }
      
      df = pandas.DataFrame(dict, columns=["name", "class", "grade"])
    </code>
    <p>
      Printing df gives you:
      <code>
        	name  class  grade
	0       John   2011     88
	1        Bob   2016     90
	2       Sara   2017     92
	3  Balthazar   2020     94
      </code>
    </p>


    <h3>Operations With DataFrames</h3>
    <p>
      god i am so tired rn DataFrames can also apply mathematical functions to change data -- on either the whole DataFrame, or individual rows or columns. Since DataFrames are multiple Series concatenated together, <code>df[index]</code> would give you one particular column, and slicing the DataFrame through calling <code>df[0:1]</code> would give you the whole first row, in this example. After this, data can be changed just as they could be in Series. DataFrames can also be sorted or sliced as is fit, and responds well to boolean conditions to grab specific sets of the data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also apply functions to whole DataFrames. Printing <code>df * 2</code> will give you:
      <code>
                                  name  class  grade
		 0            JohnJohn   4022    176
		 1              BobBob   4032    180
		 2            SaraSara   4034    184
		 3  BalthazarBalthazar   4040    188
      </code>
    </p>

    <h2>Other Cool Pandas Tricks, Because Pandas!</h2>
    <p> 
      Besides simply showing and modifying data, Pandas also has a ton of functionality in exporting or reading data easily, which really sets it apart from generic Python procedures and other libraries. 
      <br>
      So what else can Pandas do? 
      <ul>
	<li>Read and write data to Excel, so you don't have to wrangle with those cells yourself</li>
	<li>Read and write data to csvs, so you don't have to get a headache looking at walls of numbers yourself</li>
	<li>Read and write data to JSON. mongodb, <code>.txt</code> docs, and tons more -- because let's be real, you really don't wanna do that yourself</li> 
	<li>Read data from the clipboard and URLs, because who really needs to actually go through with the effort of downloading a file?</li>
	<li>Plot and subplot datasets using the <code>plt.hist</code> function</li> 
	<li>Check data, account for gaps, and drop any rows that have empty spaces automatically, or fill them with the column mean</li>
	<li>Conditional indexing</li>
	<li>Map functions (no more pesky for loops!)</li> 
	<li>Run regression and correlation numbers on statistics (in one step, as opposed to like, 17.6 in Excel)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>



    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Take a deep breath and focus your attention inwards. Reflect on your life. Think about yourself. Are you a person who uses numbers and Python, literally ever?
